THIS PROJECT IS DONE BY USING JDBC.
IN THIS WE HAVE BOOK-STORE AND CUSTOMER.
IN BOOKSTORE THE CRUD OPERATIONS ON THE BOOK CAN BE DONE BY THE BOOK OWNER.
WHENEVER THE CUSTOMER COMES TO THE BOOKSTORE HE HAS TO ENROLL IN TO THE BOOKSTORE AND CAN PURCHASE THE BOOKS THAT ARE AVAILABLE.
THE CHANGES ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN THE DATABASE.
